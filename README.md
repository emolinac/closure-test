# closure-test

## How to use?
You need two files as input. The first containing the nominal acceptance-corrected distributions. The second containing the weights of the closure test.

## Name convention
Name the files the following way:
- **input-files/pt2-distributions-nominal.root** : This file contains the acceptance-corrected data pt2 distributions.
- **input-files/phi-distributions.root** : This file contains the acceptance-corrected phi distribution from the simulations set.
